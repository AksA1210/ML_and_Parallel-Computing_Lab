Q1: Write a C/C++ program to create a thread to print first n natural numbers.
Q2: Write a program in C/C++ to create a random integer array of size n and evaluate the performance in terms of execution time.

    1. Sequential program with functions
        i.  Find the sum of elements in an array
        ii. Search a key element in an array
    2. A thread based program to partition the array and perform computation in each thread.
        i.  Find the sum of elements in an array
        ii. Search a key element in an array



Plot N - 100,500,1000,2000,5000,10000  - execution time - variation
Thread - 1,2,3,...10 (multiple)
