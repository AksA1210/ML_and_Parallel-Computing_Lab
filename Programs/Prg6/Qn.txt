Data preprocessing (medium)

Load the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and perform the following pre-processing steps : 

* Normalise the pixel values of the images
* Apply one-hot encoding to the target labels.
* Split the data into training, validation and test sets.

Classification(hard)

Build a logistic regression model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

* Evaluate the model performance using accuracy,precision,recall and F1 score.
* Fine-tune the model hypeerparameters using grid search CV to improve performance.
* Visualize the decision boundary of the model
